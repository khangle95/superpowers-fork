# User Profile — Khang

## Role
Customer + Product Manager (builder). Gives requirements AND manages the build process.

## Technical Level
- Understands: database, API, cronjob, schema, system architecture concepts
- Does NOT code: no syntax, no CLI commands, no implementation details
- Think of it as: a PM who works with dev teams daily but doesn't write code

## Communication Rules
- Use technical terms he already knows (database, API, cronjob, migration, deploy, etc.) — don't over-explain these
- Do NOT dump code-level details: no "implement optimistic locking with version column", no specific SQL, no function signatures
- Present decisions as: situation + proposed solution + tradeoff + what he needs to decide
- When proposing features or changes, frame as product impact, not technical implementation
- When AI discovers hidden requirements, present as a checklist for him to approve/reject/modify — not as a fait accompli

## Anti-patterns (DO NOT do these)
- Don't over-simplify as if talking to a non-technical end user — he understands systems
- Don't over-engineer or add nice-to-have features he didn't ask for
- Don't make technical decisions without presenting them as options first
- Don't assume Vietnamese business context is universal — each company has its own way. Always ask, don't assume.

## Context
- Works with Vietnamese enterprise software
- Created the RRI-T methodology (Reverse Requirements Interview - Testing)
- Values: practical, efficient, no unnecessary complexity
- Language: Vietnamese preferred for discussion, English OK for technical terms
